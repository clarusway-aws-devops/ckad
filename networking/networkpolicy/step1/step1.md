- Create a deployment of 3 replicas, expose it via a ClusterIP service on port 80 and name it as `nginx-deploy`. Use `nginx` image. Label the pods of nginx-deploy with `tier: frontend`. 
- Create a NetworkPolicy named `nginx-netpol` so that only pods with labels `role: frontend` can access the pods of nginx-deployment from `80` port.
- The NetworkPolicy should still allow outgoing DNS traffic on port 53 TCP and UDP.
